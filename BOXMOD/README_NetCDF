README_NetCDF
=============
PURPOSE: a basic guide to the implementation of NetCDF
         reading/writing by GECKO-A routines

BACKGROUND:
- originally, the output from the GECKO generator was all in ASCII format,
  while the link file that packaged the mechanism for the box model, and 
  the box model output were mainly in fortran-generated binary (with a few
  auxiliary ascii files).  This created several problems: 
  1) binary files were machine-specific
  2) it was possible to retain output files but NOT the mechanism/dictionary 
     files required to inperpret them, rendering useless the archived output.
         
CURRENT DESIGN:
